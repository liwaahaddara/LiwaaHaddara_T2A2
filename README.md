# **API Webserver Project (T2-A2) - Liwaa Haddara**

(Created in September, 2022)

## **_API Chosen (Problem Identification and Why)_**

- I've chosen to create an AFL (the Australian Football League) API that acts as a tool for retrieving important AFL-related statistics

- Being the major professional sporting league of Australia, the AFL receives a lot of data input to officially document any changes in the league (such as player additions and delistings, club changes, staff changes, etc)

- Having a massive fanbase (comprised of MILLIONS across the country) creates a massive demand to want to know all the latest official information surrounding a certain AFL club

- Creating this API provides (the fans, coteries, staff members, and more) an easily accessible way to retrieve any of this information at the touch of a button!
